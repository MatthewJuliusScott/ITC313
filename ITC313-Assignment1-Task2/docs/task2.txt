How it Works:
Uses JavaFX to draw coloured circles and a rectangle on a background. Uses some listeners to
change the colour of the circles when radio buttons are selected.

Assumptions:
I assumed the program might need to be modified in future, so it uses a few variables to define
size of stage etc. which can be modified without needing to reposition anything else, as they are
defined relative to those variables.
